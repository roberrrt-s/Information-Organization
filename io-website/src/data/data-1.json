Actually, Guida gets to demonstrate a few comic styling of her own as a bohemian theater \"actress\" who lives in cramped apartment with a whole bunch of other clothing-averse bohemian types. She is very devoted to her older beau Buzzanca, but his life is very complicated due to his own devotion to his very big and very old dog, the ironically named \"Piccolo\" (basically \"Tiny\"), and his even older grandmother. In order to take care of these two dependents, he forsakes his loyal girlfriend for a rich female pharmacist (Andrea Ferriola) and moves in with her and her haughty bourgeois mother and aunts--with disastrous results for all involved.",

When dognappers posing as reporters (Lynton Brent, Cy Schindell) dognap the poodle, the boys frantically try to trick Mrs. Bedford by disguising a mutt as Garçon. However, when Mrs. Bedford's maid (Libby Taylor), who is frightened of dogs, accidentally vacuums a clump of glued-on fur off the mutt's shaggy coat, Mrs. Bedford threatens to throw the Stooges in jail. Desperate, the trio use the mutt as a bloodhound to track down the crooks. When they discover the enemies' hideout, a big fight ensues. Larry and Moe get knocked out, but then Curly defeats both crooks. The boys hear Garçon quietly barking from inside a closet, only to discover that the prized poodle has had a litter of pups.",

She phones Bosko, who is asleep. Bosko's dog, Bruno, tries to wake him but fails. He answers the phone himself by knocking off the receiver and barking into the speaker. Honey asks Bruno to wake up Bosko, so the dog tries again. Even the phone does its part by sprouting hands and arms, which it uses to whistle and knock its receiver on the floor. Bosko finally answers and tells Honey he'll be right over. When Bosko arrives at Honey's place, the two of them sing and dance and play music. The kitten expresses its disdain by dumping bathwater into Bosko's saxophone, but Bosko continues to play as bubbles emerge from the bell. Honey dances on the soap bubbles, safely descending from her balcony to the ground as they pop. The kitten is soon forgotten as Bosko and Honey go for a bicycle ride... Written by J. Spurlin",

And, most importantly, rendering software had to be created by anyone wanting to do such work. It was a very primitive time for the most primitive sort of CGI, this short film is an animation that was used to demonstrate the new physics of the polygon animation.",

Jan Clayton handles the leading-lady responsibilities, while the supporting cast includes Charles Lang and Helen Parrish, who were then husband and wife (Parrish later married TV producer John Guedel, of People are Funny and Best of Groucho fame).",

These are dogs attempt to defuse situations that otherwise might result in fights or aggression. The DVD shows footage of many calming signals, how dogs use them, and how you can use them to calm your dog. This is the DVD format and companion to the popular book, On Talking Terms with Dogs.

Become a keen observer of canine behavior at home, in the community and among dogs to get better behavior and build a solid relationship.\r Learn to identify situations that are stressful to your dog so that you can resolve or avoid them.\r Filmed by the author in lovely outdoor settings, see the signals in action while Turid narrates.",

National Geographic looks at man's evolutionary manipulation of dogs' appearance, talents and temperament - and the accelerating efforts to create breeds to suit our needs (more than 80 percent of today's breeds did not exist 150 years ago). From desirable traits like supersensitive hearing and smell to the unintended consequences of genetic diseases, learn how nature and man have partnered to deliberately create new and specialized versions of man's best friend.",
